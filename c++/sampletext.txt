Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Don'tn'tn'tn'tn'tn't go gentle into that good night.

good men, the last wave he sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Don't go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on that sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Don't go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Don't go gentle into that good night - Dylon Thomas

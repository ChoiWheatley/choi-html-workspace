no man is an island,
entire of itself,
every man is a piece of the continent,
a part of the main.
if a clod be washed away by the sea,
europe is the less.
as well as if a promontory were.
as well as if a manor of thy friend’s
or of thine own were:
any man’s death diminishes me,
because i am involved in mankind,
and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
it tolls for thee.

no man is an island - john donne

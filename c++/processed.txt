1	No man is an island,
2	Entire of itself,
3	Every man is a piece of the continent,
4	A part of the main.
5	If a clod be washed away by the sea,
6	Europe is the less.
7	As well as if a promontory were.
8	As well as if a manor of thy friend’s
9	Or of thine own were:
10	Any man’s death diminishes me,
11	Because I am involved in mankind,
12	And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
13	It tolls for thee.
14	
15	No man is an island - John Donne
